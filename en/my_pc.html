    <p>Well, it just so happens that my computer is a purchased unit from 2013. It was assembled by USN company as part
        of IGROMIR series (and yes, in 2013 I was at IGROMIR and after the big crowds and queues I refused to go there
        again). Judging by <a href="http://www.dailycomm.ru/m/24594/">this article</a>, the exact model is the USN
        IGROMIR V1, although the claimed SSD unit was not
        there. The main thing is that this computer is still doing its job well today.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, the computer in such a long time was updated, first I added a terabyte HDD from the old computer, Then
        I ordered an SSD from AliExpress, and in 2020 I decided to replace the RAM and video card. In 2022, I replaced
        two 1TB drives with one 2TB drive because the first two were nearing the end of their life.</p>

    <p>The current configuration is:</p>

    <p>I think that if it were not for Microsoft's artificial restrictions, this computer would be able to handle
        Windows 11, but since they say it's incompatible, I don't even think there's any point in trying it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
