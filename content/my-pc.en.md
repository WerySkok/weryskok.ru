## My computers
### Laptop
Right now I am using <a 
href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c08081496" target="_blank">HP OMEN
16-c0001ur</a>laptop. 

A year after I bought it, I replaced the 2 bundled Samsung M471A1K43EB1-CWE 8GB 
3200 MHz RAM sticks with 2 Apacer 16GB sticks. 

Current laptop configuration is:

### Компьютер
Well, it just so happens that my computer is a purchased unit from 2013. It was
assembled by USN company as part of IGROMIR series (and yes, in 2013 I was at
IGROMIR and after the big crowds and queues I refused to go there again).
According to <a href="http://www.dailycomm.ru/m/24594/" target="_blank">this
article</a>, the exact model is the USN IGROMIR V1, although the claimed SSD
unit was not there. The main thing is that this computer is still doing its job
well today.

Of course, the computer in such a long time was updated, first I added a
terabyte HDD from the old computer, Then I ordered an SSD from AliExpress, and
in 2020 I decided to replace the RAM and video card. In 2022, I replaced two 1TB
drives with one 2TB drive because the first two were nearing the end of their
life. The power supply and cooler were replaced at the end of 2023.

Now it is rarely used since laptop's appearance.

The current configuration is:
